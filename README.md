# ML_Bootcamp_mini_projects

The Machine Learning bootcamp is the 6-Months course from UCSD that helps to develop the required skills for Data Science or Machine Learning.

The course is divided into Data extraction and/or Datacleaning with exercises using Python Numpy, Pandas, and SQL, ETL, Machine Learning algorithms and exercises and a Capstone Project.

The repository includes all the exercises that I performed during the course to earn credit.

1. Unit_2.3_ML_application:
   The Machine Learning applications.docx file is a theory on Machine Learning. The task was to identify few real world applications to get glimpse of power of ML in the real world.
 
2. Unit_2.4_Capstone_project_idea:
   The assignment is a theory assignment where we had to explore different project ideas and select one to implement and deploy in the real world.
   
3. Unit_5.3_data_wrangling_with_python:
   The unit had several lectures and optional exercises on Python Pandas package.
   The Mini_Project_Data_Wrangling_Pandas.ipynb file contains series of questions related to data manipulation and extraction using Python.
   All the questions are solved with one possible solution using Python Pandas package using PaperSpace tool.
   
4. Unit_5.4.4_json_data_wrangling_mini_project:
   The project file contains data extraction/conversion from json format to DataFrame and wrangling data using Python Pandas package in Databricks tool.

5. Unit_5.5_web_scraping_with_scrapy:
   The unit teaches the python scrapy package and includes hands-on tutorial on using python scrapy package to scrape data from multiple URL's and crawl multiple pages in a URL.      PyCharm v21.3.2 was used to scrape webpages.   
   
6. Unit_5.6_sql_with_Spark_mini_project:
   The file contains series of questions that are solved using SQL on Databricks tool.
