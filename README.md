# ML_Bootcamp_mini_projects

The Machine Learning bootcamp is the 6-Month course from UCSD that helps to develop the required skills for Data Science or Machine Learning.

The course is divided into Data extraction and/or Datacleaning with exercises using Python Pandas and SQL, ETL, Machine Learning algorithms and a Capstone Project

The repository includes all the exercises that I performed during the course to earn credit.

1. Unit_2.3_ML_application:
   a. The Machine Learning applications.docx file is a theory on Machine Learning. The task was to identify few real world applications to get glimpse of power of ML in the real world.
 
2. Unit_2.4_Capstone_project_idea:
   a. The assignment is a theory assignment where we had to explore different project ideas and select one to implement and deploy in the real world.
   
3. Unit_5.3_data_wrangling_with_python:
   a. The unit had several lectures and optional exercises on Python Pandas package
   b. The Mini_Project_Data_Wrangling_Pandas.ipynb file contains series of questions related to data manipulation and extraction using Python.
   c. All the questions are solved with one possible solution using Python Pandas package.
   
4. Unit_5.4.4_json_data_wrangling_mini_project:
   a. The Kunal_Doshi_Unit_5.4.4_Data_Wrangling_Json_mini_project file contains data extraction/conversion from json format to DataFrame and wrangling data using Python Pandas package
